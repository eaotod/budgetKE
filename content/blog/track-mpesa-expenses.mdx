M-Pesa is the backbone of the Kenyan economy, but its convenience often leads to "shrapnel spending"—those small daily transactions that add up to significant amounts by the end of the month.

In this guide, we'll show you how to take control of your M-Pesa statement and turn it into a powerful financial growth tool.

## 1. Categorize Your Transactions

Most M-Pesa users only look at their balance. To really track your money, you need to know where it's going. Divide your spending into:

- **Essential Bills** (Rent, Tokens, Water)
- **Daily Living** (Groceries, Fare)
- **Business/Work** (Supplies, Data)
- **Lifestyle** (Dining, Entertainment)

## 2. Separate Personal and Business

If you're an entrepreneur, never pay personal bills from your Till or Paybill. It makes bookkeeping a nightmare.

## 3. Use a Digital Tracker

While the M-Pesa app has basic tracking, our **Budget Master Pro** template allows you to import your statement and see visual charts of your progress.
