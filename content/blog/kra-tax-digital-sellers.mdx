The digital economy in Kenya is booming, and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) is paying close attention. As a digital seller, staying compliant is key to long-term success.

## 1. Digital Service Tax (DST)

If you sell services or digital products online, you may be liable for DST. It's currently a small percentage of the gross transaction value.

## 2. Income Tax

Regardless of where you sell, your profit is taxable. Keep clean records of your expenses (like data, marketing, and supplies) to reduce your taxable income.

## 3. VAT on Digital Services

Some digital platforms are now required to charge VAT. Understanding how this affects your pricing is crucial.

## 4. Record Keeping

KRA requires you to keep records for at least 5 years. Our **Small Business Bookkeeper** makes this automated and stress-free.
