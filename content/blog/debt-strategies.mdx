If you have multiple loans—mobile apps, credit cards, bank loans—deciding which one to pay first can be confusing. Mathematically there's one answer, but psychologically there's another.

## The Debt Avalanche (The Mathematical Choice)

With this method, you pay off debts in order of **interest rate**, from highest to lowest.

1.  List all debts.
2.  Rank them by Interest Rate (Highest first).
3.  Pay minimums on everything else, and throw every extra shilling at the top one.

**Pros**: You save the most money in the long run.
**Cons**: If your highest interest loan is huge, it takes a long time to see a "win."

## The Debt Snowball (The Psychological Choice)

Here, you ignore interest rates and pay off debts in order of **balance**, from smallest to largest.

1.  List all debts.
2.  Rank them by Balance (Smallest first).
3.  Pay minimums on everything else, and attack the smallest one.

**Pros**: You get quick wins. Clearing a 5k loan feels good and gives you momentum.
**Cons**: You technically pay more interest over time.

## Which Should You Choose?

If you are disciplined and motivated by numbers, choose **Avalanche**.
If you feel overwhelmed and need to see progress to stay motivated, choose **Snowball**.
