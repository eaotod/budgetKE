Many farmers in Kenya operate on a "hope strategy." They plant, hope for rain, hope for good prices, and hope there's money left over at the end.

But professional agribusiness requires data. You need to know exactly how much it cost to produce that crate of tomatoes.

## Variable vs. Fixed Costs

- **Variable Costs**: These change with production. Seeds, fertilizer, casual labor, pesticides. If you don't plant, you don't pay these.
- **Fixed Costs**: These happen regardless. Land lease, permanent staff salaries, equipment depreciation.

To be profitable, your **Gross Margin** (Sales - Variable Costs) must be high enough to cover your Fixed Costs and leave a profit.

## Tracking Crop Cycles

Farming is unique because expenses happen months before income. You spend money in March to get paid in July.

You should track each cycle (or block) as a separate project.

- **Block A (Cabbages)**: Inputs = 50k, Sales = 120k. Profit = 70k.
- **Block B (Potatoes)**: Inputs = 40k, Sales = 35k. Loss = 5k.

Without detailed tracking, you might think the whole farm made 65k, not realizing that potatoes actually _cost_ you money.

## Importance of Labor Tracking

Labor is often the biggest hidden cost. If you or your family work on the farm, that time has value. Even if you don't pay yourself cash, record the hours. This shows the _true_ cost of production.

## Conclusion

Turn your shamba into a business. Stop guessing and start tracking. The most successful farmers aren't just good at growing crops; they're good at managing numbers.
