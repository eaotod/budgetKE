Owning a home in Nairobi is a dream for many, but the rising costs can make it feel impossible. With a clear plan, you can turn that dream into a title deed.

## 1. Define Your Target

Nairobi real estate varies wildly between locations like Syokimau, Ruaka, or Kikuyu. Research the prices and set a concrete savings goal.

## 2. The 20% Deposit Rule

Aim to save at least 20% of the property value as a deposit. It reduces your mortgage burden and gives you better negotiating power.

## 3. Automate Your Savings

Treat your house fund like a bill you MUST pay every month. Use Saccos or high-yield savings accounts to get better interest.

## 4. Track Every Shilling

Use our **Savings Goal Planner** to visualize your progress. Seeing the bar fill up every month keeps you focused when the urge to spend arises.
