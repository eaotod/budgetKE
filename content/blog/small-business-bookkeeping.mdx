If you're like most Kenyan entrepreneurs, you started your business because you're passionate about your product, not because you love Excel spreadsheets.

But as your business grows, "winging it" with your finances becomes dangerous. You need a system.

## Why Bookkeeping Matters

1.  **Cash Flow Management**: You might be making sales, but if you don't know when expenses are due, you can still go broke.
2.  **Tax Compliance**: KRA requires accurate records. Trying to reconstruct a year's worth of receipts in June is a nightmare.
3.  **Growth**: You can't improve what you don't measure. Which product is your most profitable? Which expense is eating your margins?

## Essential Records to Keep

- **Sales Invoices**: Every shilling that comes in.
- **Expense Receipts**: Supplier payments, rent, electricity.
- **Bank Statements**: Monthly reconciliation to ensure your books match the bank.
- **Asset Register**: Laptops, furniture, and equipment owned by the business.

## The DIY Approach vs. Hiring

Hiring an accountant is great, but expensive for a startup. Most small businesses (under 5M annual revenue) can easily manage their own books with the right template.

## Weekly Routine

Set aside 1 hour every Friday morning.

1.  Log all sales for the week.
2.  Scan/photo all receipts and log expenses.
3.  Check who owes you money (Accounts Receivable) and send reminders.

## Conclusion

Don't let financial chaos kill your business dream. Start simple, stay consistent, and use tools that make the job easier. Your future self will thank you.
