Chamas are the heartbeat of Kenyan savings culture. However, many fail because of poor record-keeping and a lack of transparency.

## 1. Digital Records over Paper

Paper books get lost or liquid damaged. Digital records in a shared Google Sheet or our **Chamaa Management System** ensure everyone has access to the truth.

## 2. Regular Reporting

Don't wait for the monthly meeting to show the balances. Send a weekly or bi-weekly summary so members feel connected to their money.

## 3. Clear Rules on Penalties

Transparency isn't just about the money; it's about the rules. Ensure everyone knows the cost of late contributions up front.

## 4. Individual Statements

Each member should be able to see their total contributions and any loans at a glance. It reduces friction and builds long-term trust.
