One of the biggest mistakes Kenyan entrepreneurs make is using one M-Pesa line or bank account for both household shopping and business supplies.

## 1. Transparency

When you separate your accounts, you can see exactly how much your business is making. "Business is doing well" is a feeling; a separate bank statement is a fact.

## 2. Better Decision Making

You can't know if you can afford that new piece of equipment if your profit is mixed with your house rent money.

## 3. Tax Compliance

KRA audits are much easier to handle when your business transactions are clearly isolated.

## 4. Professionalism

Paying suppliers from a business-named Paybill or account builds trust and shows you're serious.
