Excel is more than just a grid for numbers; it's a powerful business engine. For Kenyan SME owners, mastering a few key features can save hours of manual work every week.

## 1. Pivot Tables

Pivot tables allow you to summarize thousands of rows of sales data in seconds. You can instantly see your best-selling products or busiest days of the week.

## 2. Conditional Formatting

Use this to highlight low inventory in red or overdue payments automatically. It turns your spreadsheet into a visual dashboard.

## 3. Data Validation

Stop making typos! Use dropdown lists for your product names and expense categories to ensure your records are always clean.

## 4. VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP

Automatically pull prices or customer details into your invoices. No more manual searching.

## 5. Charts and Graphs

Visualizing your profit trends helps you make better decisions for the future of your business.
